/**
 * @brief This test case is designed to verify the functionality of the BoolCondition BT node.
 *
 * Test Scenario: Emergency Stop
 * - A Behavior Tree is created with a single BoolCondition node.
 * - The node is configured to listen to the "/emergency_stop" topic.
 * - A `true` message is published to the topic.
 * - The test asserts that the BoolCondition node returns FAILURE, which is the expected
 * behavior for a condition that signals a stop or an error state.

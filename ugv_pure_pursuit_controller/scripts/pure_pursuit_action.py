    """
    PurePursuit implements a ROS-based pure pursuit controller for Ackermann-steered vehicles.

    This class sets up ROS publishers for crosstrack error and Ackermann drive commands,
    and an action server to receive waypoint goals. It tracks a path using the pure pursuit
    algorithm, computing steering commands to follow a sequence of waypoints.
    The controller stops the robot when the goal is reached or if the action is preempted.

    Attributes:
        rate (rospy.Rate): Control loop rate.
        look_ahead (float): Lookahead distance for pure pursuit (meters).
        wheelbase (float): Vehicle wheelbase (meters).

        crosstrack_err_pub (rospy.Publisher): Publishes crosstrack error.
        ackermann_pub (rospy.Publisher): Publishes Ackermann drive commands.
